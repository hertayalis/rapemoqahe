A young woman named Ashley falls in love with a romance author in her town. However, she is plunged into a menacing love triangle and begins to discover more and more secrets about the people in her life.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>Universally panned but a casual watch for fans of 365 Days, a seemingly innocent woman once again falls for the wrong man and suffers greatly for it.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Wild Things</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Neve Campbell and Denise Richards: need we say more? Wild Things might not be the first film you think of when you think of 365 Days, but it’s a phenomenal watch, and if we’re aging ourselves here — so be it. A thriller of epic proportions and it hinges on more of a crime aspect than it does flat-out explicit scenes, but it has those, too.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>The real pull to this one is the sexy game of whodunit that takes place as jealousy rages, fingers are pointed, innocence is questioned, and a long game is being played. Who wins, who loses, and who won’t survive to see the end? You’ll have to watch to find out.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Through My Window</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>Through My Window is a more recent addition to Netflix and a mesmerizing one at that. When Raquel’s neighbor, who has long been the object of her affection, begins paying attention to her, it changes things for the young woman. Gone is the meek girl who saw a boy through her window and yearned for him, and here becomes a woman who feels more alive than she ever has before.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>However, not every romance leads to a happily ever after feeling of butterflies and making each other better; some hinge on jealousy, passion, and steamy moments that ease the burn of the ones that hurt you instead. Through My Window takes both sides of that coin and turns it into something you just have to see more of, and the ending of this one will be the icing on top of the cake.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Addicted</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=628 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>In this erotic psychological thriller, Sharon Leal stars as Zoe, a woman who, on paper, has it all. She’s the CEO of her own company and the perfect husband and two wonderful children. While previous stories show that the leading lady is often starved sexually, Zoe is not and is intimate with her husband numerous times daily. That’s why things begin to go south when she begins an affair with two men. Unable to control her desires, she throws her life away, as she constantly seeks sexual pleasure. Her insatiable appetite threatens to ruin all she has built as severe consequences for her actions begin to line up.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>Will she realize that her actions are allowing every part of her life to go awry, or will she be swept up in lust and romance that will inevitably cause her life to crash down around her, leaving her unable to pick up the broken pieces?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>After</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>After’s softer rating prevents it from diving headfirst into full erotica, but it does touch on many similar subjects as the films on this list. Much like 365 Days, After showcases a tumultuous relationship founded on shaky ground, this time between two college students named Tessa and Hardin. When Tessa initially arrives at college, she is determined to stay on course and not get carried away with other factors, but the sexy mystery of Hardin leads her down a thrilling sexual path as the two embark on an intense relationship.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>“Intense relationship” might be putting it mildly, actually, and while the movie might not show the details of intensity the way some of the other films do, the romance between Tessa and Hardin is just as hot, if not hotter, than many we mention on this list.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Below Her Mouth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Below Her Mouth is an erotic thriller that follows two women, Dallas and Jasmine. While Dallas had recently ended a relationship, Jasmine was still engaged to a man, but the two share found one another and began feeling an instant connection. Their attraction proves toxic and chaotic as Jasmine fights to deny her true feelings, and Dallas remains persistent in the quest for a blossoming yet intense relationship.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Will Jasmine ever give into what Dallas brings out in her, or will her comfort in her day-to-day life be too overwhelming to leave behind? In many films and series where erotica is a draw away from an existing relationship, it often also serves as the igniting factor that eventually burns the bridge that allowed the bond to exist at all. A fling might be fun (in these films, we don’t condone cheating here), but are they ever really enough to make you leave it all behind?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Newness</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>Newness is a film that aims to explore all the many complexities in a relationship. Gabriella and Martin match on a dating app and quickly fall in love and move in together, believing they are happy with one another. When they both cheat on the same night, they confess their betrayal to one another and decide to have an open relationship. While Newness isn’t as dark as 365 Days, it is honest and passionate in showing the complications of love.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>It also shows the complications of joining into relationships that aren’t exactly textbook. No longer as taboo as they once were, gone are the days when a “traditional” relationship was the only one ever portrayed in media or real life; Newness touches on an open relationship while also highlighting the need for not just honesty but vulnerability in any bond you share with another.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>After We Collided</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>Yes, we already recommended After to you, but After We Collided is another film in the Tessa and Hardin story, and we had to mention it as its own addition to the list because it takes things from spicy to full-on hot as they explore their relationship on a new playing field.</p><p data-characters=551 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>Tessa and Hardin are experiencing a new chapter of their lives with new people and new experiences, and that goes for what they’re doing with one another, too. While Tessa hopes to be strong enough to leave Hardin behind if he can’t be the man she needs, she also sees the fact that he’s awakened feelings and emotions in her she never knew before, sexually and emotionally. This one is definitely more passionate, and it’s also a new chapter for those who can’t get enough of the pull and push between Tessa and Hardin.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Boy Next Door</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=824 data-injectable=true>The Boy Next Door leans more heavily into the thriller genre than 365 Days does, but it is still an engaging and steamy erotic movie. The story is centered on Claire, who is recently divorced and living alone with her teenage son. When a 19-year-old boy named Noah moves into the house next to hers, she tries her hardest to deny the sexual chemistry between them, but they eventually share a passionate night. Claire tries to avoid him after that, but things take a twisted turn as Noah grows dangerously obsessed with her.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>It should surprise no one that Noah would grow to be infatuated with Claire, and this one is more of a warning than many on the list to tread carefully into relationships where one person holds the power and the other is thirsty for it. That kind of bond will never end well.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Killing Me Softly</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Alice is an American woman living in London.

When Dr. Bill Harford’s wife, Alice, admits that she wants to have an affair, his ego is bruised, and he decides to act on his emotions after her admission. What happens next is something neither of them could have prepared for. Bill soon finds himself in the throws of a forbidden lifestyle, and Alice, well, she’s intrigued by it.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>If you’ve not seen this one, we won’t give it away, but there are criminal elements at play, too, adding more mystery to everything surrounding Bill’s chance encounter and Alice’s confession. The question posed here is, once again, is sexual excitement worth uprooting your everything for, and if so, how long can it all really last?</p><h2 id=h-betty-blue data-injectable=false>Betty Blue</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Betty Blue is a romantic thriller that is about a woman named Betty who begins a sexual relationship with a handyman. That relationship is made more complicated by her reckless behavior which continues to escalate throughout the film. The movie is stunningly stylized and is filled with steamy moments that are similar to 365 Days.</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>Betty Blue was even nominated for an Oscar, which indicates how excellent of a film it truly is.</p><h2 id=h-secretary data-injectable=false>Secretary</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Secretary starred Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader and is an erotic romance movie.
